See each folder's readme for a more detailed description of specific challenges

## Sales Commission ##

You're a regional manager for an office beverage sales company, and right now you're in charge of paying your sales team they're monthly commissions.\
Sales people get paid using the following formula for the total commission: commission is 6.2% of profit, with no commission for any product to total less than zero.\

## Word Funnel ##

A word funnel is a series of words formed by removing one letter at a time from a starting word, keeping the remaining letters in order.  
Given a word, determine the length of the longest word funnel that it starts. You may optionally also return the funnel itself (or any funnel tied for the longest, in the case of a tie).

## Single-Symbol Squares ##

Given a grid size N, find an NxN layout of X's and O's such that no axis-aligned square (2x2 or larger) within the grid has the same symbol at each of its four corners. That is, if four cells of the grid form a square, they must not be either all X's or all O's.\

## Hexidecimal Colors ## 

One common way for software specifications such as HTML to specify colors is with a hexadecimal string.
All three channel values must be an integer between 0 (minimum brightness) and 255 (maximum brightness). In all cases the hex values are two digits each, including a leading 0 if necessary.

## Ducci Sequences ##

A Ducci sequence is a sequence of n-tuples of integers, sometimes known as "the Diffy game", because it is based on sequences. Given an n-tuple of integers (a_1, a_2, ... a_n) the next n-tuple in the sequence is formed by taking the absolute differences of neighboring integers.\
Some Ducci sequences descend to all zeroes or a repeating sequence. An example is (1,2,1,2,1,0) -> (1,1,1,1,1,1) -> (0,0,0,0,0,0).\
